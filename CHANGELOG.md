- V 0.21.0: Added a neat CLI density plot for calibrated dates
- V 0.20.2: Some performance improvements for the calibration of large numbers of dates
- V 0.20.1: Better (parsing) error handling
- V 0.20.0: Added an option --allowOutside to allow for calibrations to run outside the range of the calibration curve
- V 0.19.0: Added functionality to filter out dates outside of the range of the calibration curve and report an error in this case
- V 0.18.0: Implemented calibration with a StudentT distribution to mimic Bchron and established that as the new default. Reimplemented the --method option of the CLI tool to reflect that change
- V 0.17.0: Changed argument order in CalCurve data type to adjust to the order in .14C files
- V 0.16.0: Refactoring in the library to simplify and clarify the interface
- V 0.15.0: Added another calibration algorithm (following the implementation by Andrew Parnell in Bchron) and a method switch for the CLI
- V 0.14.0: Introduced strictness, which brought a significant increase in performance. See the discussion here: https://old.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/picjy6/how_could_i_improve_the_performance_of_my/
- V 0.13.0: Major rewrite with the vector library - includes multiple bugfixes, but is surprisingly slow
- V 0.12.0: Renamed some core functions
- V 0.11.0: Made calibration curve interpolation optional and turned it off by default
- V 0.10.0: Simplified CLI interface by dropping the "calibrate" subcommand (currycarbon is sufficient now) and by repurposing -q from --quickOut to --quiet
- V 0.9.0: Made --hdrFile output a lot more machine-readable
- V 0.8.0: Added option --calibrationCurveFile to calibrate with different calibration curves
- V 0.7.2: More documentation, small changes in code layout and renamed CLI module that provides runCalibrate
- V 0.7.1: Added type documentation with haddock and replaced the existing types with record types
- V 0.7.0: Changed the date input interface once more
- V 0.6.0: Changed the date input interface, because parenthesis can be part of valid lab numbers
- V 0.5.2: Fixed parallel evalutation (deepseq forced memory-intensive, non-lazy behaviour)
- V 0.5.1: Added github release action (copied from poseidon-hs)
- V 0.5.0: Added file input for dates to calibrate
- V 0.4.0: Made output calibrated dates negative numbers for BC and positive for AD - and adjusted HDR printing accordingly
- V 0.3.2: Some optimisation
- V 0.3.1: Added automatic filling of unknown sample names
- V 0.3.0: Simplified interface
- V 0.2.1: Removed ascii plot functionality
- V 0.2.0: Added parallel processing for the main calibration operation
- V 0.1.0: First basically working version
