- V 0.4.0.2: Support for `optparse-applicative-0.19.0.0`.
- V 0.4.0.1: Support for `random-1.3`. Now possible, because MonadRandom supports it as well (https://github.com/byorgey/MonadRandom/blob/master/CHANGES.markdown#062-5-march-2025).
- V 0.4.0.0: Another major update:
    - Added more calibration curves next to `intcal20`: `shcal20` and `marine20`. Renamed the `Currycarbon.CalCurves.IntCal20` module to just `Currycarbon.CalCurves`. In the CLI, `--calCurveFile` is now just `--calCurve`, and it allows to either select the different packaged curves or read arbitrary .14c files.
    - Added a new CLI plot element to the output of individual dates. `renderCLIPlotCalCurve` plots a relevant section of the calibration curve.
    - Added the command line options `--noTrimCalCurve` and `--noTrimOutCalPDF` to allow control over the pre- and post-calibration trimming behaviour for radiocarbon dates.
    - Changed the way products between calibration expressions are computed in `evalCalExpr`. Input expressions in a multiplication are now calibrated for the entire length of the calibration curve. This allows to compute proper products and not fail in case of non-overlapping output.
    - Changed the way calibration curves are embedded in currycarbon. This now uses the brilliant `file-embed` library.
    - Changed the interface of the core calibration functions. `CalibrateDatesConf` no longer includes the `CalibrationMethod`, so `calibrateDates` and `evalNamedCalExpr` functions need it as an extra argument. `calibrateDateBchron` and `calibrateDateMatrixMult` now take `CalibrateDatesConf` and not its individual elements.
    - Moved from Float to Double for probability densities and all functions that interact with them.
    - Added a new output option `--basicFile` to the CLI to enable simple per-expression output: The minimum start and maximum end of the high probability density regions and the median age. In this context `writeCalC14` was split into `writeCalC14HDR` and `writeCalC14CalRangeSummary` in the library.
    - Added little axis labels (BC/AD) to the command line plot to improve readability.
    - Changed the release pipeline: Now again with a windows executable. currycarbon-macOS was replaced by currycarbon-macOS-X64 and currycarbon-macOS-ARM64.
    - Switched to a new GHC version (v9.6.6) and stackage resolver version (lts-22.43).
- V 0.3.0.1: The golden tests can not run on stackage as it stands, so I hid them behind an environment variable.
- V 0.3.0.0: Major update with multiple breaking changes and new features:
	- Added a new mechanism to draw random age samples from a CalPDF (`sampleAgesFromCalPDF :: AgeSamplingConf -> CalPDF -> RandomAgeSample`). This is available from the command line with the options `samplesFile`, `--seed`, and `-n`/`--nrSamples`.
	- Added a new concept to the `CalExpr` data type: Age ranges with uniform probability for each year in the range (`TimeWindowBP` and `TimeWindowBCAD`).
	- Reworked the encoding and evaluation mechanism for calibration expressions:
		- Introduced the `NamedCalExpr` as a wrapper around `CalExpr` with an identifier, and then adjusted the ID generation for `CalPDF`s to prioritize this identifier.
		- Reworked the CLI DSL to support a standardized configuration language syntax implemented in a new module `ParserHelpers.hs`. This introduces a set of flexible functions (`calExpr()`, `uncalC14()`, `rangeBP()`, `rangeBCAD()`, `sum()` and `product()`) which generally complement the previously available syntax and operators. The old syntax is mostly preserved as syntactic sugar for the new, more standardized syntax. Unfortunately this is not entirely seamless: The change breaks some expressions that were valid before (e.g. `"3000,30 + 3020,50"`). They now require additional parentheses to pass (so e.g. `"(3000,30) + (3020,50)"`).
		- Added some unit tests to cover the increasingly complex DSL.
	- Changed the output files from .csv to .tsv and to a more meaningful and consistent set of column names.
	- Slightly adjusted the rendering of the pretty, human-focussed command line output.
	- Updated and improved the command line documentation.
	- Renamed some CLI arguments:
		- `--calibrationCurveFile` -> `--calCurveFile`
		- `--calCurveSegmentFile` -> `--calCurveSegFile`
		- `--calCurveMatrixFile` -> `--calCurveMatFile`
	- Changed the CLI behaviour with  `--calCurveSegFile` and `--calCurveMatFile`: currycarbon now fails with these options if the first sample is not a single, uncalibrated radiocarbon date (so `uncalC14()`).
	- Added a simple golden test system with some basic calls to the `currycarbon` CLI tool.
	- Switched to a new GHC version (v9.4.7) and stackage resolver version (lts-21.17).
- V 0.2.1.2: Maintenance: Switched to a newer compiler/resolver version, lifted some dependency restrictions, ran stylish-haskell on the entire codebase, updated the github actions, deprecated the haddock documentation for the dev version on GitHub.
- V 0.2.1.1: Lifted some restrictions regarding the upper version bounds of dependencies.
- V 0.2.1.0: Added a mechanism to detect terminal encoding and fall back on a simpler CLI plot if it is not UTF-8.
- V 0.2.0.1: Brought sample names back to default CLI output.
- V 0.2.0.0: Added sum (and product) calibration and made the necessary changes to various interfaces (including CLI) to make this functionality accessible.

The latter got refactored and enhanced in the process. `HDR`s are now "ordered", so `_hdrstart` actually stores the older and `_hdrstop` the younger date.

- V 0.19.0: Added functionality to filter out dates outside of the range of the calibration curve and report an error in this case.
- V 0.18.0: Implemented calibration with a StudentT distribution to mimic Bchron and established that as the new default. Reimplemented the `--method` option of the CLI tool to reflect that change.

- V 0.16.0: Refactoring in the library to simplify and clarify the interface.
- V 0.15.0: Added another calibration algorithm (following the implementation by Andrew Parnell in Bchron) and a method switch for the CLI.

- V 0.11.0: Made calibration curve interpolation optional and turned it off by default.
- V 0.10.0: Simplified CLI interface by dropping the `calibrate` subcommand (`currycarbon` is sufficient now) and by repurposing `-q` from `--quickOut` to `--quiet`.

- V 0.8.0: Added option `--calibrationCurveFile` to calibrate with different calibration curves.
- V 0.7.2: More documentation, small changes in code layout and renamed CLI module that provides `runCalibrate`.
- V 0.7.1: Added type documentation with haddock and replaced the existing types with record types.
- V 0.7.0: Changed the date input interface once more.
- V 0.6.0: Changed the date input interface, because parenthesis can be part of valid lab numbers.
